David Albuja (1900863)

This Branch contains the followings files for Project 3:

Assignment 1:
* Assigment_1_Code.ipynb: The code to provide the data of the exper policy
* dataset_assigment1.csv: The csv file with the output (data) of the previous code.

Assignmnet 2:
* Main_Code_Assigment_2.ipynb: The complete code for computing the expert iterations
* Training the classifier_Assignment 2.ipynb: The file has the code that shows the different test computed for three classifers (random forest, extra trees and decision tree) to choose the best one for the main code.
